## Quality Assurance Tools

This collection includes scripts to maintain and improve skill quality:

### Outcome Evals

The `evals/` and `experiments/` directories contain the current outcome-based harness:

- **Structural lint** for frontmatter and format checks
- **Routing evals** for skill discoverability and false-positive control
- **Length-controlled behavioral evals** using skill-vs-placebo prompts
- **Objective SWE-bench localization evals** for debugging skills
- **SQLite dashboard** for reviewing eval and experiment results

Current evidence is documented in the [Elevate-or-Kill Scorecard](analysis/ELEVATE-OR-KILL-SCORECARD.md) (canonical single source of truth for all 39 skills) and the [Executive Synthesis](analysis/ELEVATE-OR-KILL-SYNTHESIS.md). The mission's headline result: **zero skills currently hold a robust, replicated ELEVATE verdict.** `thinking-scientific-method` (hypothesis-differential debugging) is the closest candidate: its M5 fresh primary scored +5.3pp (p=0.061, n=150, directional) and its replication was significant (+8.0pp, p=0.001), but the primary's borderline p-value fails the paired-test gate — final verdict DIRECTIONAL-NOT-REPLICATED. A pre-registered larger-N study is recommended as future work. All 39 skills remain shipped; no directories were removed. See `analysis/ELEVATE-OR-KILL-SYNTHESIS.md` for the full executive summary and `analysis/FUTURE-CONSOLIDATION-PLAN.md` for a proposed (unexecuted) consolidation plan.

### Validate Skills

Check all skills against quality criteria:

```bash
node scripts/validate-skills.js
```

Outputs a report showing:
- Required sections present/missing
- Quality metrics (examples, tables, checklists)
- Overall score per skill
- Skills needing attention

### Generate Enhancement Suggestions

Get specific improvement suggestions for a skill:

```bash
# Single skill
node scripts/enhance-skill.js thinking-first-principles

# All skills summary
node scripts/enhance-skill.js
```

### Generate AI Improvement Prompts

Create prompts for Claude to enhance skills:

```bash
node scripts/generate-improvement-prompt.js thinking-bayesian
```

This generates a detailed prompt you can use with Claude Code to systematically improve any skill.

## Detailed Skill Descriptions

### First Principles Thinking
Strip away assumptions to reveal fundamental truths, then rebuild solutions from basics. Championed by Elon Musk and rooted in Aristotle's philosophy.

**When to use:**
- Conventional approaches have failed
- You're told something is "impossible"
- Need innovation, not incremental improvement

### Bayesian Reasoning
Update beliefs systematically based on new evidence. Provides a framework for thinking about probability and uncertainty.

**When to use:**
- Estimating probabilities or likelihoods
- Interpreting test results or metrics
- Making decisions with incomplete information

### Systems Thinking
View problems as part of interconnected wholes with feedback loops and emergent properties. Essential for debugging complex distributed systems.

**When to use:**
- Debugging spans multiple components
- Fix in one place breaks another
- Behavior seems emergent or unexpected

### Theory of Constraints
Every system has exactly one constraint limiting throughput. Optimizing anything else is wasted effort. Based on Eliyahu Goldratt's work.

**When to use:**
- Performance optimization
- Process improvement
- Resource allocation
- Identifying bottlenecks

### Scientific Method / Hypothesis-Differential Debugging
Localize an ambiguous bug by enumerating falsifiable hypotheses, ranking them by likelihood x cheapness-to-check, and making the cheapest discriminating observation first.

**When to use:**
- A symptom could plausibly come from several files/functions/components
- You can inspect code, logs, diffs, traces, or tests now
- You need to localize the fault before applying root-cause analysis

### Cynefin Framework
Classify problems by the relationship between cause and effect: Clear, Complicated, Complex, or Chaotic. Each domain requires a different approach.

**When to use:**
- Choosing methodologies
- Understanding why approaches fail
- Crisis management

### Jobs to Be Done
Customers don't buy products—they hire them to do jobs. Understanding the job unlocks innovation.

**When to use:**
- Product development
- Feature prioritization
- Understanding customer behavior

### Red Team Thinking
Attack your own plans before adversaries do. The best defense is knowing your weaknesses.

**When to use:**
- Security review
- Pre-launch preparation
- Plan stress-testing

   - Overview and core principle
   - When to use decision flow
   - Step-by-step process
   - At least 2 practical examples
   - Reusable template
   - Verification checklist
   - Key questions
